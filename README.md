# Huffman Coding Visualizer

## Overview
The Huffman Coding Visualizer is a web application that allows users to input a string of text and visualize the Huffman coding process. The application builds a Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters in the input text, generating a set of variable-length codes for efficient data compression. 

## Features
- **Text Input**: Users can enter any string of text for encoding.
- **Huffman Codes Display**: The application displays the generated Huffman codes for each character.
- **Huffman Tree Structure**: The visual representation of the Huffman tree is displayed.
- **ASCII Code Calculation**: The application shows the ASCII codes for the characters in the input text.
- **Compression Ratio**: The ratio of Huffman codes to ASCII codes is calculated and displayed.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A Python web framework used for building the web application.
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: Used for handling user input and making API requests.
- **Heapq**: Python's built-in library for implementing heaps.
